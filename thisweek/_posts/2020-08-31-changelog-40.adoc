Release: release:2020-08-31[]

== Sponsors

This week we want to thank https://www.technocreatives.com/[The Techno Creatives], a Gothenburg-based creative tech house merging strategy, design, and technology to catalyze innovation.

**Become a sponsor:** https://opencollective.com/rust-analyzer/[opencollective.com/rust-analyzer]

== New Features

* pr:5859[] automatically publish rust-analyzer crates with `ra_ap` prefix: https://crates.io/search?q=ra_ap.
  You can use these crates to build your own tooling on top of rust-analyzer, which can be compile with stable `rustc`.
  Note that we provide **no** backwards compatibility guarantees.
  Building external tooling on top of rust-analyzer libraries is a non-goal at the moment.
* pr:4873[] resolve links in hover documentation.
