Commit: commit:fbb8b884a2dbc3ced720c84f4604466e223f6d69[] +
Release: release:2020-05-25[]

In the effort to improve support for all editors, and to speedup acceptance of rust-analyzer extensions to the Language Server Protocol, all extensions are now documented:

[`lsp-extensions.md`](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/1527feb744c7911b6ca482554f0399d3ef0ebfdc/docs/dev/lsp-extensions.md)

If you maintain rust-analyzer plugin for some editor, consider implementing these extensions and giving feedback for the corresponding upstream issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/.
Additionally, consider subscribing to [#4604](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/4604), which will announce all future extensions and changes.
Note that we don't have any compatibility guarantees yet -- all our extensions are subject to change on a short notice.

== Sponsors

Starting this week, we'll be mentioning our significant Open Collective backers of "Sponsor" level or higher in the changelogs.

This week, we welcome a new sponsor: https://www.prisma.io/[Prisma], a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript built with Rust under the hood.
