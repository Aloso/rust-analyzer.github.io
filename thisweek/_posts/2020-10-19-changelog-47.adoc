* pr:6153[] aggressively pre-warm caches on startup.
  This should reduce latency in some cases, and give better indication about when rust-analyzer is fully ready.
* pr:6137[], pr:6248[], pr:6275[] add a new TextMate grammar.
* pr:6130[] quick fix to change casing of names.
* pr:6230[] improve logging during sysroot discovery. Use `RA_LOG=project_model=debug` to see those logs.
* pr:6240[] document auto-import: https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#import-insertion[manual.html#import-insertion].
* pr:6242[] suggest field shorthand in patterns.
* pr:6220[] implement binary operator overloading type inference.
* pr:6246[] follow symlinks when crawling the project tree.
  This doesn't implement full support for symlinks, but fixes some of the cases.

== Fixes

* pr:6277[] **Change Visibility** assist works for type aliases.

* pr:6199[] fix semantic highlighting for `mut self`.
* pr:6198[] improve semantic highlighting of macro rules.
* pr:6195[] when shortening iterator hints, recursively shorten associated types.
* pr:6213[] fix "Invalid request: experimental/resolveCodeAction" panic.
* pr:6209[] fix auto-import merge behavior for full/last options.
* pr:6222[] fix stackoverflow in `insert_use::recursive_merge`.
* pr:6236[] prevent editors from forming ligatures with inlay hints.
* pr:6234[] fix hover over field pattern shorthand.
* pr:6262[] remove some incorrect completions.
* pr:6271[] complete method calls when receiver is a macro.


== Internal Improvements

* pr:6260[] switch build automation to use https://github.com/matklad/xshell[xshell]
* pr:6208[] debug a befuddling failure on CI.
  Turns out, macOS tar is broken, and can corrupt cargo's caches, which would result in "`crate not found`" compilation errors.
* pr:6207[] make auto-import infrastructure more reusable.
* pr:6226[] test that all rust-analyzer's protocol extensions are documented.
* pr:6228[] add https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AS-actionable[S-actionable] and https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AS-unactionable[S-unactionable] issue labels.
* pr:6231[] split syntax highlighting into more modules.
* pr:6233[], pr:6239[], pr:6250[] additions to style guide.
* pr:6276[] move completion into a separate crate.
